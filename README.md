## Environments

- Application Infrastructures
  - This application would be implemented basically based on GCP(Google Cloud Platform) stacks
    - `GAE: Google App Engine`
      - With this app, we use `SE (Standard Edition)` where the app deployed
    - `Cloud Build`
      - For application buildings, we use Cloud Build when some codes would be updated
      - As GAE also internally uses `Cloud Build`, we provide some parameters for customizations of application builds with configuration file, `cloudbuild-app.yaml`
    - `GCS: Google Cloud Storage`
      - For artifacts of app, which are automatically generated by Cloud Build, would be stored in GCS bucket
    - `Berglas`
      - Also for storing secrets for apps, which would be encrypted by `Google KMS` keys & keypairs, we use `Berglas` tools
        - Though Berglas is not offical products of GCP, but are developed by Google
        - For more information about Berglas, please refer the link below:
          - <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/berglas>
      - With features of Berglas, we have some choices for its backends, `GCS` and `Secret Manager`
        - With this app, we use `GCS` for Berglas backends, and we can manage them directly with `berglas` CLI and `gsutil`
    - `Google Domains`
      - For using custom domains of this application, we purchased it with `Google Domains`, which are domain services managed by Google
      - Also for secure connections, we added SSL configurations to the app with the feature of Google Domains

- Runtime and Component versions
  - Node.js: `v13.12.0`
    - with using `nodebrew` for split Node.js version
